## This script creates Apache Benche traffic that looks like attack traffic. It is designed to work with the Juice Shop application.It must run
## after the juice_bados_baseline.sh script has been running for approximately 5-10 minutes in
## order to see Behavioral DoS critical attacks. It should run at the same time as a
## juice_bados_baseline.sh.
#
# If you want to debug, change the first line to #!/bin/bash -x
# to get the student_id number from SSH_CLIENT env variable
# if SSH_CLIENT is not set, the script will exit
#
#if [ -n "$SSH_CLIENT" ]; then
#   student_id=$(echo $SSH_CLIENT | cut -f3 -d.)
#else
#   echo "SSH_CLIENT variable is not set, cannot continue, exiting"
#   exit 1
